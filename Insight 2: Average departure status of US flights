###Design and summary:
My question is to find the average departure status (on time or delayed) of the flights from the 
origin airport.
To find this, I looked up at the Departure Delay field. I created a new calculated field called 
‘Departure status’ with the following calculation
if AVG ([Departure Delay]) <=0 then 'On time'
else 'Delay'
End
I added airport and departure status as a filter. I also added Average Departure delay to the tooltip 
in the Marks tab.
From the data, I can conclude that only around 37 airports have the average departure status of ‘on 
time’. Most of the airports has the average departure status as ‘Delay’
