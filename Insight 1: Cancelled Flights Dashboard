###Design and summary:
My question is to find out which state has the most cancelled flights and for what reason.
I created an interactive dashboard for this.
I added latitude, longitude in rows and columns appropriately. Then added the cancelled sum to the 
colour in Marks tab. Then added Month as filter. Before that I changed the Month data type from 
Number to String and created aliases for numbers such that 1-Jan 2-feb and so on till 12-Dec. This 
filter allows us to view the number of cancelled flights per month.
Then, I added cancellation reason in rows. I also renamed the Aliases such that A â€“ Airline, BWeather, C-Air system.
I created another horizontal bar chart that shows the cancellation reasons count. Depending on how 
you filter out these state-wise as well as month-wise, both the map as well as the horizontal bar 
changes accordingly.
From this, of all months and all states, I can conclude that the state with the most cancelled flights is 
Texas with a total of 668 of which 422 is due to Weather and 202 is due to airline and 44 due to air 
system.
