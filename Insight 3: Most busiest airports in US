###Design and summary:
My question is to find the busiest airport based on the total number of flights that took off from 
each airport.
I added origin airport as rows and count of flights as columns and designed it as a circle chart type. I 
also created a group with the first 10 airports as the Top 10 busiest airport and added a filter for the 
same.
I also added state in the tooltip so that we know the state where the airport is located as well.
From the visual, I can conclude that the airport with the greatest number of flights (count - 18,056) is 
from ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) airport. The least being MVY (Martha's 
Vineyard Airport) with a count of 2 flights. From the tooltip, we can say that the state with the 
greatest number of flights is GA.
